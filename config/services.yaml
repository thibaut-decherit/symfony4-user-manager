  # Tweak these two values according to server hardware. It is recommended that server response doesn't take more than
  # 1 second during "normal" login.
  # Feel free to ignore the 1 second limit for important passwords (e.g. admin account), you would then have to create a
  # dedicated encoder for admin users, with higher values for these two settings.
  # See https://symfony.com/doc/current/security/named_encoders.html
  # Bear in mind that login will take longer if OnAuthPasswordRehashIfCostChange is triggered and has to rehash the
  # password. This situation should therefore not be considered as a "normal" login and could take more than 1 second.
